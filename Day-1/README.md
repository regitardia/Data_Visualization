Welcome to Data Visualization!

In this hands-on course, you'll learn how to take your data visualizations to the next level with seaborn, a powerful but easy-to-use data visualization tool. To use seaborn, you'll also learn a bit about how to write code in Python, a popular programming language. That said,the course is aimed at those with no prior programming experience, and each chart uses short and simple code, making seaborn much faster and easier to use than many other data visualization tools (such as Excel, for instance).
